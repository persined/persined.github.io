# Tokenomics

Pkmn Yellow is an experimental, community-driven token. There will only **ever** be 151 tokens!

You can **only** send or receive at most one (1) Pkmn Yellow per transaction! We believe this is more fair to the community and it provides a more level playing field.

No presale! This is a fully decentralized and community driven project! The entire supply is allocated to Pancakeswap. LP tokens are burned and liquidity is locked forever.

The dev account does hold 5 Pkmn Yellow tokens. These will be given away to the community to kickstart and celebrate launch!

# Future Plans

We are a group of developers who have become fascinated with the world of cryptocurrencies. We wanted to take a novel idea (pkmn) and try to apply its "catch em' all" philosophy to the blockchain. This is very experimental!

We have some ideas in the works right now, including:

* NFTs for each of the 151 pokemon. These will only be purchasable with Pkmn Yellow tokens!
* Staking. We are brainstorming different ideas for how we could enable staking for a token of such low quantity.

If you have any ideas, feel free to send them to us!
